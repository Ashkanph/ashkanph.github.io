He also said: “When you wonder if you should go or not, don’t go.” And: “When you wonder if you should eat or not, it is better not to eat. When you wonder if you should die or not, it is better to die.”<br><br>\n<p>From the first book</p>\n</div><br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nIn the Kamigata region, people carry multi-layered picnic boxes with them for enjoying the cherry blossoms. They are only used for one day, and having served their purpose, people just stamp on the boxes and discard them as they leave. It is indeed a capital conception. The end is important for all things.<br><br>\n<p>From the second book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nWhile walking together along the path, Master Jōchō proclaimed, “Are men not like masterfully controlled puppets? It is magnificent craftsmanship that allows us to walk, jump, prance, and speak even though there are no strings attached. We may be guests at next year’s Bon festival. We forget it is an ephemeral world in which we live.”<br><br>\n<p>From the second book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nIt is discerning to behold the world as if it were a dream. You want to quickly wake up if you have a nightmare, and are relieved that it was only a dream. This world in which we exist now is no different.<br><br>\n<p>From the second book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nTwo warriors met on a one-lane bridge but refused to give way, threatening to cut each other down if the other did not move. A radish seller came between the two men, and catching each one on either end of his shoulder-carrying pole, picked them up and spun them around to the opposite ends of the bridge. There are many ways of solving problems, and this counts as constructive service to one’s lord. It is most unfortunate to see precious retainers die needlessly, or create needless discord.<br><br>\n<p>From the second book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nThe original intention of love is to take it with you to the grave. There is a poem that goes, \"Observe when I am dead, my internal burning love for you, from the smoke ascending from my body.\" When I suggested that this was analogous to the highest form of love, they all concurred, and thereupon we called ourselves the 'smoke blokes'.\n<br><br>\n<p>From the second book</p>\n</div>\n<p>ناخودآگاه به یاد این شعر حافظ افتادم:<br><br>\nبگشای تربتم را بعد از وفات و بنگر / کز آتش درونم دود از کفن برآید\n<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nWith the passing of Lord Kōkokuin, his aide Ezoe Kinbei took his ashes to Mount Kōya to be consecrated. Kinbei then shut himself away in a hermitage and carved a figurine of his master from wood, and another of him prostrating before him. Kinbei returned home, probably on the first anniversary of his death, and committed oibara. The statue he carved was brought from Mount Kōya and enshrined at the Kōdenji Temple in Saga.<br><br>\n<p>From the third book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nWritten in the Gunpō-kikisho, “Win first, then attack” is the essence of certain victory. Resourcefulness in peacetime means preparing for war. You must be able to defeat an enemy of 100,000 men with a force of 500.<br><br>\n<p>From the third book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nWarriors in olden times used to grow mustaches because their ears and noses would be removed and taken by the enemy as proof of their triumph in battle. The mustache was cut off together with the nose to confirm that the trophy head was that of a man and not a woman. If the head was found to be clean-shaven, it was just left to rot in the mud. A samurai cultivated his drooping mustache to ensure that his head, once removed, was not unceremoniously discarded. Master Jōchō said, “A man’s complexion will not change after being killed in battle, so long as he washes his face every morning.”\n<br><br>\n<p>From the third book</p>\n</div>\n<br>\n<p>جنگجویان قدیم سبیل می‌گذاشتند، چرا که در گذشته به علامت آن‌که یک مرد در جنگ کشته شده ‌است، گوش و دماغش را می‌بریدند و به اردوی خود می‌بردند، و برای آن‌که آن شخص با یک زن اشتباه گرفته نشود،‌سبیلش را نیز به همراه بینی‌اش می‌بریدند. در این هنگام اگر بر صورت وی سبیل نبود، سر جنگجو را به دور می‌انداختند تا با سر یک زن اشتباه نشود. از این‌رو، سبیل گذاشتن یکی از طریقت سامورایی‌ها بود تا بدین‌سان هیچگاه سرشان پس از مرگ به‌دور افکنده نشود.<br></p>\n<p>چونه‌تومو گفته است، اگر انسان صورت خود را هر روز با آب بشوید، پس از کشته‌شدن، صورتش رنگ و رخسار خود را از دست نخواهد داد.\n<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nA certain man said, “There is a poem from the shrine [of Sugawara no Michizane] that goes: ‘If one follows the path of sincerity in his heart, although he may not pray, will the deities not watch over him?’ What can ‘path of sincerity’ possibly mean?” Another man answered. “As you appear to be partial to poetry, allow me to respond in verse. ‘Inasmuch as all things in this world are deceptive, sincerity is revealed only in death.’ Living as if already dead is how to embody the path of sincerity.”<br><br>\n<p>From the third book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nWhen the priest Ungo Oshō from Matsushima was traversing through the mountains one evening, he was ambushed by a bandit. Ungo exclaimed: “I am from this region. I am no itinerant priest. I have no money. I will give you the clothes I wear, but entreat you not to take my life.” The bandit reacted, “This is a wasted effort. I have no need for clothes,” and moved on. After walking a distance of around 1-chō, Ungo turned and hailed him back. “I have broken my vows by telling an untruth. As I was so flustered, I forgot about this piece of silver in my purse, even though I claimed to have no money. Do not be angry with me. Here it is, please accept it.” The bandit was awestruck by his admission. He shaved off his hair on the spot, and became a disciple.<br><br>\n<p>From the third book</p>\n</div>\n<br><br>\n<hr>\n<br><br>\n<div class=\"ltr\">\nThe following are teachings of Yamamoto Jin’uemon.<br><br>\n<ol>\n<li>Young men should not engage in poetry, reading graphic novels, gō, shōgi, or other such activities that will cause listlessness.

Some things turn out contrary to one’s liking. I would be a little taller if I was to chop your head off and attach it to my feet, but I am unable to have it my way.”<br><br>\n<p>From the third book</p>\n</div>","frontmatter":{"date":"January 28, 2020","slug":"/blog/hagakure","title":"هاگاکوره","description":"پاراگراف‌هایی از کتاب هاگاکوره نوشته یاماموتو تسونه‌تومو","tags":["ژاپن","سامورایی","هاگاکوره","طریقت"],"dir":"rtl","jdate":"سه‌شنبه، ۸ بهمن ۱۳۹۸"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/hagakure"}},"staticQueryHashes":["4211208203"]}
